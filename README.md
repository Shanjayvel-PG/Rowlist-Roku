# Roku-GooglePhotos (aka Roku-PhotoView)
In early 2018, this channel went through a complete rewrite to intigrate ScreenGraph features required by Roku. The old UI features were being decommished at the end of 2018. 

If you enjoy this Roku channel, please remember to rate! Ratings provide a virtual word of mouth and promote more code development. Thank you -- Chris Taylor /developer

## Developing Code
Want to help integrate a new feature? Outside development is welcomed as long as the new code adds to user experience. Any new development work should be tracked in an "Issue" and assigned to yourself. Once ready to commit code, merge into the 'development' branch for testing. After all tests have passed, it would be merged into the 'master' branch and released during next release cycle.

## Questions or commits
Please open an 'Issue' in the above section. Don't ask about advertising, because the answer is NO!
